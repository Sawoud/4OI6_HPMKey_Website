    <p style="padding: 1%">
        Damages from cybercrime are increasing rapidly year over year. From the perspective of a user, the best way to secure their accounts is by creating a secure password. To maximize security, the password must be both complex and entirely secure – this makes them very difficult to remember!
        <br><br>The HPMKey (Hardware Password Manager) is a small USB device that puts the safety of your login information back into your hands. Equipped with biometric fingerprint scanning, the device acts as a skeleton key that is securely bound to the user. Rest easy knowing that your passwords are safe and secure.
        <br><br>By taking the burden of remembrance off of the user, they are able to follow the security doctrines of complexity and uniqueness, which allows them to create much more secure passwords. This gives the user the same benefits of a software password manager without the need for any software or an internet connection. The device is completely target-agnostic, emulating a USB keyboard. This enables it to function on any device that accepts USB.

                    Sawoud is a Computer Engineering student that has completed a 12-month Internship as a Software Developer at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries – Regional Jets. His main tasks was completing the Windows application portion of the capstone and the website creation, the application was written in a .NET framework (version 4.7.2), using WinForms for the GUI, the PORTS library to communicate to the device over UART, and AES256 for the encryption of data (SHA256 for hashing).
                    The application gives the user the ability of managing the HPMKey's entries, as well as generating completely random passwords based on requirements provided by the user, to ensure there is even more randomness in the generation, the application depends on the current time to add an additional layer of security for the user.
